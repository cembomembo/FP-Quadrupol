\section{Introduction}

Mass spectrometry is a versatile analytical technique used to investigate the composition of atomic and molecular species and plays an important role in many areas of modern science.
In physics and chemistry, it is widely applied whenever gas mixtures or residual gases need to be analyzed with high sensitivity and selectivity.
Among the various types of mass spectrometers, the quadrupole mass spectrometer stands out due to its compact design, robustness, and suitability for operation in high and ultra-high vacuum environments.
For this reason, it has become a standard tool in vacuum diagnostics, residual gas analysis, and experimental research setups~\cite{jousten_ellefson_partialdruckmessung_2017}.

In this experiment, gas samples are ionized, mass-selected by a quadrupole mass filter, and detected as an electrical signal, resulting in characteristic mass spectra.
Different gases and gas mixtures are examined, allowing their composition and fragmentation patterns to be analyzed.
In addition, the influence of experimental parameters such as applied voltages, pressure conditions, and operating modes on mass resolution, transmission, and signal quality is investigated.
The measurements provide a practical basis for the interpretation of mass spectra and the assessment of the performance limits of a quadrupole mass spectrometer.

\section{Physical Principles}

In this section, the physical principles underlying the operation of a quadrupole mass spectrometer are outlined.
The discussion follows the path of the particles through the instrument, from ionization and transport under vacuum conditions to mass-selective filtering, detection, and the interpretation of the resulting mass spectra.

\subsection{Mass Spectrometry and Ionization}

Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique used to investigate the composition of atomic and molecular species by separating charged particles according to their mass-to-charge ratio.
Since neutral atoms and molecules cannot be manipulated by electric fields, the species under investigation must first be converted into ions.
The measured quantity in a mass spectrometer is therefore not the mass itself, but the ratio of mass to charge $m/z$, where $m$ denotes the ion mass and $z$ its charge state in units of the elementary charge.
Different ions with the same mass but different charge states are thus separated at different $m/z$ values, while ions of different mass may appear at similar $m/z$ positions if their charge states differ.

A mass spectrometer generally consists of three essential components: an ion source, a mass-selective analyzer, and an ion detector.
In the ion source, neutral gas particles are ionized and accelerated into the analyzer region.
The analyzer separates the ions according to their $m/z$ value using electric or magnetic fields, and the transmitted ions are finally detected and converted into an electrical signal.
A schematic overview of these basic components is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mass_spectrometer}.
In the present experiment, mass selection is performed by a quadrupole mass filter (QMF) operating with time-dependent electric fields~\cite{QMSAnleitung}.

  \label{fig:mass_spectrometer}
\end{figure}

Ionization in the quadrupole mass spectrometer used in this experiment is achieved by electron impact ionization.
Electrons are emitted from a heated filament by thermionic emission and accelerated to energies typically on the order of several tens of electronvolts.
When these electrons collide with neutral gas molecules, they can remove an electron and thereby produce positive ions.
Due to the relatively high electron energies, this process often transfers excess energy to the molecule, leading to the formation of fragment ions in addition to the molecular parent ion.

As a consequence, a measured mass spectrum generally consists of multiple peaks corresponding to different ionic fragments of the same molecule.
These fragmentation patterns are characteristic for a given species and can be used to identify unknown gases or gas mixtures.
Under typical operating conditions of electron impact ionization, singly charged ions ($z = 1$) are predominantly observed, so that the measured mass-to-charge ratio $m/z$ closely corresponds to the molecular or fragment mass $m$.
Multiply charged ions may occur but usually do not play a dominant role in residual gas analysis~\cite{demtroeder_atome_molekuele_2005}.


\subsection{Vacuum Requirements and Mean Free Path}

The operation of a mass spectrometer requires high vacuum conditions in order to ensure collision-free motion of ions between the ion source, the mass analyzer, and the detector.
At elevated pressures, frequent collisions with background gas molecules would disturb the ion trajectories, lead to energy loss and scattering, and thereby degrade mass resolution and transmission.
Vacuum conditions are therefore an essential prerequisite for reliable mass-selective filtering and accurate interpretation of measured mass spectra.

The relevance of vacuum quality can be quantified by the mean free path $\lambda$ of gas particles, which describes the average distance traveled between successive collisions.
For an ideal gas, the mean free path is given by
\[
\lambda = \frac{k_{\mathrm{B}} T}{\sqrt{2}\,\pi d^{2} p},
\]
where $k_{\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ the temperature, $d$ the effective molecular diameter, and $p$ the gas pressure.
A sufficiently large mean free path compared to the characteristic dimensions of the mass spectrometer is required to ensure that ions can traverse the analyzer region without significant collisional perturbations.

Quadrupole mass spectrometers are therefore typically operated in the high to ultra-high vacuum regime.
In residual gas analysis, pressures on the order of $10^{-6}\,\mathrm{mbar}$ or lower are commonly required, corresponding to mean free paths that exceed the length of the quadrupole rods by several orders of magnitude~\cite{jousten_ellefson_partialdruckmessung_2017}.

\subsection{Principle of the Quadrupole Mass Filter}

The quadrupole mass filter separates ions according to their mass-to-charge ratio by means of a time-dependent electric quadrupole field.
It consists of four parallel metallic rods arranged symmetrically around the ion beam axis, with opposite rods electrically connected.
Ideally, the electrodes would have hyperbolic cross sections in order to generate a perfect quadrupole field, but in practice cylindrical rods are used as a good approximation~\cite{demtroeder_atome_molekuele_2005}.

A static electric quadrupole potential has a saddle-shaped structure.
This means that ions are focused toward the axis in one transverse direction, while they are simultaneously defocused in the perpendicular direction.
In other words, static quadrupole fields can act like a lens in one plane, but they necessarily act like an anti-lens in the other plane.
Therefore, purely static operation cannot provide stable confinement in both transverse directions at the same time, and ions are inevitably driven into the rods.
Stable transmission through the quadrupole is therefore only achieved by superimposing a static (DC) voltage with an alternating radio-frequency (RF) voltage applied to the rod pairs with opposite polarity.

The superposition of DC and RF voltages produces a time-dependent electric field in which ions perform oscillatory motion perpendicular to the flight direction.
Depending on their mass-to-charge ratio, these oscillations can either remain bounded or grow in amplitude until the ion collides with one of the rods.
Only ions whose trajectories remain stable in both transverse directions are able to pass through the quadrupole and reach the detector, while all others are filtered out.
This principle is illustrated schematically in Fig.~\ref{fig:qmf_principle}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../resources/figures/qmf_principle.png}
  \caption{Schematic illustration of ion motion in a QMF.
  Ions with suitable mass-to-charge ratios exhibit stable oscillatory trajectories and are transmitted to the detector, while ions with unstable motion are lost to the electrodes~\cite{shimadzu_mass_analyzers}.}
  \label{fig:qmf_principle}
\end{figure}

By varying the applied DC and RF voltages while keeping their ratio constant, the QMF can be operated as a mass-selective device.
In this mode, ions are transmitted sequentially according to their mass-to-charge ratio, allowing a mass spectrum to be recorded.
The detailed conditions for stable and unstable ion motion are described by the equations of motion in the quadrupole field and are discussed in the following subsection.
